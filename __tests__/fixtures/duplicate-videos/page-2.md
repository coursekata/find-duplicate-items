# Chapter 2 - Understanding Data

## 2.0 Starting With a Bunch of Numbers

When statisticians talk about variation, they refer to a particular kind of
variation: variation in data. But variation doesn’t start out as data. Look
around; you see people, buildings, trees, light, and so on. And you see lots of
variation: no two people look exactly alike, just as no two trees look exactly
alike. Statisticians seek to express this variation using numbers, which is
where we will start. (In a bit we will discuss where the numbers come from.)

Not all groups of numbers have variation. Take, for example, these numbers: 2,
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2. No need to use statistics in this case, because there is
no variation. You can just look at the numbers and describe them in a phrase:
"Nine twos." If we said, "What number best represents this distribution of
numbers?" you would, almost certainly, say, “Two.”
