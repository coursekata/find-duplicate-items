# Chapter 2 - Understanding Data

## 2.0 Starting With a Bunch of Numbers

When statisticians talk about variation, they refer to a particular kind of
variation: variation in data. But variation doesnâ€™t start out as data. Look
around; you see people, buildings, trees, light, and so on. And you see lots of
variation: no two people look exactly alike, just as no two trees look exactly
alike. Statisticians seek to express this variation using numbers, which is
where we will start. (In a bit we will discuss where the numbers come from.)
