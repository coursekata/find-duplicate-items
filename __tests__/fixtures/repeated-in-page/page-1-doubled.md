# Chapter 2 - Understanding Data

## 2.0 Starting With a Bunch of Numbers

When statisticians talk about variation, they refer to a particular kind of
variation: variation in data. But variation doesn’t start out as data. Look
around; you see people, buildings, trees, light, and so on. And you see lots of
variation: no two people look exactly alike, just as no two trees look exactly
alike. Statisticians seek to express this variation using numbers, which is
where we will start. (In a bit we will discuss where the numbers come from.)

Not all groups of numbers have variation. Take, for example, these numbers: 2,
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2. No need to use statistics in this case, because there is
no variation. You can just look at the numbers and describe them in a phrase:
"Nine twos." If we said, "What number best represents this distribution of
numbers?" you would, almost certainly, say, “Two.”

But take this group of numbers: 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1. Now it’s not as easy
to describe them—certainly not in a short phrase. And imagine if there were
hundreds or thousands of numbers; the challenge would be even greater.

### Seeing Patterns in Numbers

Statisticians have, over the years, invented some ideas and some procedures to
help us make sense of bunches of numbers. Here’s a simple example. First, see if
you can create a vector to store the numbers 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1.

In the code window below, we put in the code to create a vector with nine 2s. We
saved it in an R object called `bunch_of_2s`. Now you add the code to create a
vector called `bunch_of_123s` with the numbers 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1. (HINT:
use the `c()` function.) Run the code, then add some code to print out the two
vectors just to make sure they ended up with the numbers you intended.

```{ data-ckcode=true #ch2-1 }
%%% setup
require(coursekata)

%%% prompt
# Here's how to combine nine 2s into a vector
# You could also use rep(2, times = 9)
bunch_of_2s <- c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)

# Create a vector called bunch_of_123s with the numbers
# 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1
bunch_of_123s <- c()

%%% solution
bunch_of_123s <- c(2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1)

%%% test
ex() %>% check_object("bunch_of_123s") %>% check_equal()
```

Now, let’s take the numbers in `bunch_of_123s` and sort them in ascending order.
We can use the `sort()` function for this.

```
sort(bunch_of_123s)
```

```
[1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
```

Now look at the numbers in `bunch_of_123s` after we have sorted them. Suddenly
it is easier to see a pattern in the variation: there are equal numbers of 1s,
2s, and 3s. Just sorting numbers makes it easier to see a pattern!

If you understand this example, you have just mastered your first statistical
technique! It may not look like much, but if you had a bigger data set (instead
of nine numbers) you would quickly see the advantages of simply sorting them in
order.

### Frequency Tables

We could also represent the same pattern in a frequency table using the command
`tally()`.

```
tally(bunch_of_123s)
```

```
X
1 2 3
3 3 3
```

```{ data-ckcode=true #ch2-2 }
%%% setup
require(coursekata)

%%% prompt
# Here is code to create the vector that we named bunch_of_2s
bunch_of_2s <- c(2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2)

# Now, let's run the tally() function on bunch_of_2s

%%% solution
# Here is code to create the vector that we named bunch_of_2s
bunch_of_2s <- c(2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2)

# Now, let's run the tally() function on bunch_of_2s
tally(bunch_of_2s)

%%% test
ex() %>% check_function("tally") %>% check_result() %>% check_equal()
```

```
X
2
9
```

Believe it or not, you’ve now learned a second statistical technique—frequency
tables (implemented in R as the `tally()` function)! As you learn more and more
about statistics, you will encounter lots and lots of techniques like this.
Fundamentally, they are all variations on just a few core ideas. As you go, and
as you build up your statistical power, we will help you keep it all in
perspective.
