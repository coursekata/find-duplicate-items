<p>When statisticians talk about variation, they refer to a particular kind of variation: variation in data. But variation doesnâ€™t start out as data. Look around; you see people, buildings, trees, light, and so on. And you see lots of variation: no two people look exactly alike, just as no two trees look exactly alike.
